# Counselling WIth Iqra website built using 11ty and Nunjucks

This website was built for a client who wanted to have blogging capabilities. This was my first client and this was early in my web development stage. 

The website was originally made on a custom wordpress theme, which i had cretated. The client wanted the least amount of charges for hosting the website, so an obvious choice was netlify's free hosting.

The website is built using good old fashioned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, under 11ty as a static site generator and Nunjucks as the templating engine.
